## Environment Description

The EV charging environment simulates a network of charging stations based on real data from the Caltech Adaptive Charging Network (ACN). The environment features:

- **24-hour episodes** with 5-minute decision intervals (288 steps)
- **Network constraints** enforced through convex optimization
- **Stochastic EV arrivals** based on historical patterns
- **Carbon-aware optimization** using Marginal Operating Emissions Rate (MOER)

## Core Concepts

### Observation Space
- Current timestep and estimated departures
- Energy demands per station
- Previous and forecasted MOER values

### Action Space
- Normalized charging rates [0, 1] per station
- Actions projected to satisfy network constraints

### Reward Structure
- Profit from energy delivered
- Carbon cost based on MOER
- Penalty for constraint violations

## Data Sources

- **ACN-Data**: Real charging session data from Caltech campus
- **CAISO MOER**: California grid carbon intensity data
- **Network Topology**: Transformer and feeder capacity constraints

## Implementation Details

The environment is built on:
- **Gymnasium** for standard RL interface
- **CVXPY** for constraint projection
- **NumPy/Pandas** for data processing
