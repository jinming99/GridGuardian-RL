## Overview

This tutorial introduces the EV charging environment and its safety mechanisms. You will learn how the environment models real-world charging infrastructure constraints and how actions are projected to maintain network safety.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the observation and action spaces
- Explore network constraint formulation
- Implement safety projections using convex optimization
- Analyze the impact of Marginal Operating Emissions Rate (MOER)
- Visualize constraint binding patterns

## Resources

### Jupyter Notebook
[**View on GitHub**](https://github.com/jinming99/GridGuardian-RL/blob/main/tutorials/01_ev_env_safety_robustness.ipynb)

### Supporting Materials
- [Python Script](https://github.com/jinming99/GridGuardian-RL/blob/main/tutorials/01_ev_env_safety_robustness.py) - Jupytext paired version
- [Technical Notes](https://github.com/jinming99/GridGuardian-RL/blob/main/tutorials/01_ev_env_constraints_robustness_control.md) - Extended documentation

## Key Concepts

- **Constraint Projection**: Actions are projected onto feasible set via quadratic programming
- **Network Safety**: Transformer and feeder capacity limits enforced at each step
- **MOER Integration**: Real-time carbon intensity affects reward calculation

## Prerequisites

```python
from envs.evcharging.env import EVChargingEnv
from data.load_moer import load_moer_data
import cvxpy as cp
```

## Duration

Approximately 30 minutes
