## Overview

This section contains step-by-step tutorials for implementing safe and robust reinforcement learning algorithms in power system environments. The tutorials are organized by environment type, allowing for focused learning within specific application domains.

## Available Environments

### [EV Charging Environment](ev/index.qmd)

A comprehensive tutorial series covering electric vehicle charging coordination using the Caltech Adaptive Charging Network (ACN) data. Topics include:

- Environment setup and constraint handling
- Baseline controllers and benchmarking
- Standard and safe reinforcement learning
- Multi-agent coordination
- Advanced diagnostic and optimization techniques

**Status:** Complete (8 tutorials)

### Future Environments

Additional power system environments are planned for future releases:

- **Building Energy Management**: HVAC control and demand response
- **Microgrid Operation**: Distributed energy resource coordination
- **Transmission Network**: Optimal power flow and stability control

## Prerequisites

All tutorials require:

```bash
# Python 3.10-3.12
pip install -r tutorials/requirements-tutorials.txt
```

## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows a consistent format:

1. **Overview**: Problem context and motivation
2. **Objectives**: Specific learning outcomes
3. **Implementation**: Link to Jupyter notebook
4. **Resources**: Additional documentation and references
