# GridGuardian-RL Tutorials — Code of Conduct

This project and its community are dedicated to providing a welcoming, safe, and collaborative environment for everyone.
We adopt the principles and structure of the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1).

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by opening a GitHub issue in the repository and describing the concern. If a private channel is required, you may request one in the issue and a maintainer will follow up. If there is an immediate threat to safety, contact local authorities.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction
- Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
- Consequence: A private, written warning by community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and explaining why the behavior was inappropriate.

2. Warning
- Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
- Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

3. Temporary Ban
- Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
- Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

4. Permanent Ban
- Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression.
- Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
